Python Program for simple interest
Simple interest formula is given by: 
Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 
Where, P is the principal amount 
T is the time  
R is the rate.



# Get user inputs for principal, time, and rate
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate: "))

# Calculate the simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * time * rate) / 100

# Print the simple interest
print("The simple interest is:", simple_interest)
